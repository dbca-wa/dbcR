## Where the code lives
There are several workflows to write R scripts.

### Scripts spewing products
* Data lives on local spreadsheets or on local file shares. (`C:\data\spreasheet.csv`)
* R code lives inside a script. (`script.R`)
* The code runs in the current working directory (bonus is predictable).
* The code is commented inline.
* The script spews outputs (bonus if in predictable location).
